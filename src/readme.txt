SUPER GUN BROS

**Description**
Super Gun bros is a platform game. In the game, Mario must race through 
the Mushroom Kingdom and save Princess Peach from Bowser.  Mario jumps, runs, 
and walks across each level. The worlds are full of enemies and platforms, and 
open holes. If Mario touches an enemy, he dies. If he falls down a hole or 
misses a jump, he will also lose a life. Mario has a  "power up" at the end 
of the map before getting into the castle, an AK-47.
